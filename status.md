Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have been brainstorming ideas for my project and have decided on what I'm going to do. I also started my project by creating a couple scenes on Godot Engine. I added a sprite2D rocket to the player scene and got a script for it. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

What I haven't done for my project yet is creating the meteors(obstacles) scene, the laser for the rocket, the script for meteor, laser, the main scene and also collisions for them. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I'm just struggling with how I'm going to write the script for them. For this specific problem, I think I'm going to read the documentation in Godot Engine and watch some tutorials on Youtube to get used to writing script, create collisions, signals and functions in Godot. 


The truth is that the moment I'm filling out these questions, I'm already done with my project. This is just me having a flashback of what I had already done on Nov 24. The reason I'm submitting this late is because I literally did not notice about the existence of this "Progress Report" assignment on Canvas at that time, I just thought the Final Project assignment was the one we all focusing on. That's totally my bad, I hope I can still have a chance to have a grade for this assignment(even if it's a partial grade).
