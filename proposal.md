# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Shoot and Run


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A asteroid dodge gamge where players have to try their best to avoid getting hit by the obstacles(rocks) and they're also able to shoot out to destroy obstacles in front of them.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

For my final project, I am making a 2D top-down survival game in Godot. The goal is to move around and avoid enemies that keep spawning on the screen, going from the top to bottom screen. As time goes on, the enemies get faster, which makes the game more challenging(if possible).

I am planning to add features like a score system, a health bar, and power-ups such as speed boosts or shields. When the player loses all their health, the game will show a game over screen with the final score and a restart button.

I will be using GDScript (Godot is coding language) to handle player movement, enemy logic, collisions, and scoring. The game will be playable as a small executable file that starts from a simple menu and then goes into the main game.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope. 
Is this a question or just your comment in general?

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

For me, a good outcome for my final project is to get it running and no matter what because a game that that is not able to run is no longer a game, that's just a scenes with a background behind. Also, for me, a game that is considered succesful means that its instruction and rules are clear enough for the players to understand. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for my final project includes everything I mentioned above and some of the extra features that I planned to do if time allows:
+Health record system: Players have 3 hearts, every time get hit, lose 1 heart
+Power-up items: lightning bolt to help players speed up in 3 seconds and shield orb makes players invincible in 5 seconds


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Since this is just a learning-experience project, so I expect myself to learn through making game and have fun at the same time. However, I still want to make sure that my game still meets all the requirements and on top of all, making the professor have fun playing my game is my top goal.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

For the next steps, I'll focus on learning more about how Godot handles movements, collisions, and obstacles spawning. I plan to watch a few tutorials and practice scripting in GDScript, since it is similar to Python but has its own setup for handling game objects and scenes. I will also need to learn how to add sound effects, track scores, and create a simple menu screen.

My plan is to go from the basic to complicated, which means that I'll start by finishing creating the map(background), player movement, obstacles system, and then work on the visuals and power-ups. And the following step is trying to test the game to make sure everything runs smoothly without any bugs/errors. My goal is to learn more about how different scripts interact in Godot and how to make a small but complete and playable game.
